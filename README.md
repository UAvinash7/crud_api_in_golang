# crud_api_in_golang
Create, Read, Update, and Delete API's using golang's built-in packages.
In this project we are going to maintain the employee data.
Here as of now, we are not going to use any database, instead we will be using the program's memory.

Run the project using the `go run main.go` command.

Let's now check the functionality of our API's using postman.
